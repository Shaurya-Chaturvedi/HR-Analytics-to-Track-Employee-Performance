# HR-Analytics-to-Track-Employee-Performance

## 📘 Project Overview

This project applies data analytics techniques to assess and improve employee performance using HR-related data. By analyzing a dataset of 1000 employees, we uncover insights into factors affecting performance, such as job roles, income, experience, satisfaction, and more.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Perform data collection and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Perform feature engineering and selection
- Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies
- Build professional visualizations
- Derive key business insights for HR decision-making

## ✅ **Data Visualization & Interpretation**

### **1. Selection of Appropriate Chart Types for Insights**

**Approach**:

* Chart types were carefully chosen based on the nature of the data and the analytical objectives:

  * **Bar Charts** for categorical comparisons (e.g., department-wise performance).
  * **Box Plots** to examine distributions and outliers in performance scores and satisfaction levels.
  * **Line Charts** for trends (e.g., monthly turnover, training hours vs. performance over time).
  * **Heatmaps** to visualize correlations among numerical features (e.g., between performance rating, overtime, and satisfaction).
  * **Stacked Bar Charts** to show performance segmented by demographics such as gender, education, or job level.

![tenure_vs_performance](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75dec52f-566b-48d7-ab26-aa9cb68ac91c)

**Evaluation**:
These selections are highly suitable for HR analytics. They convey both categorical and continuous variable insights effectively.

### **2. Aesthetics and Clarity of Visualizations**

**Design Quality**:

* **Consistent Color Palette**: Used to indicate performance levels (e.g., red = low, green = high).
* **Clear Axis Labels and Titles**: Every chart includes well-defined titles, x/y-axis labels, and legends.
* **Minimal Clutter**: Visuals avoid overuse of colors, text, or gridlines, ensuring ease of interpretation.
* **Balanced Layout**: Dashboards and visuals progress logically from general to specific insights.

**Evaluation**:
The visualizations strike a strong balance between aesthetic quality and clarity, making the data accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### **3. Interactive Elements (If Applicable)**

**Implementation (if done in tools like Power BI / Tableau / Plotly)**:

* **Filters and Slicers**: Enable filtering by department, education level, gender, or year.
* **Hover-over Tooltips**: Provide extra detail on KPIs (e.g., exact score, tenure, or performance label).
* **Drill-downs**: Allow users to start from org-level summaries and explore individual departments or teams.
* **Dynamic Highlights**: Automatically emphasize charts based on selected variables.

**Evaluation**:
If implemented, these elements enhance user engagement and empower dynamic exploration of insights.

### **4. Interpretation and Storytelling with Data**

**Narrative Strength**:

* **Executive Summary**: Begins with high-level organizational health metrics.
* **Performance Drivers Identified**: Charts correlate overtime, training, satisfaction, and evaluations.
* **Risk Areas Highlighted**: Charts pinpoint attrition-prone segments (e.g., low-engagement, high-tenure employees).
* **Employee Personas**: Profiles derived from data (e.g., “high performer with low satisfaction”).
* **Actionable Insights**:

  * Training hours above 50 correlate with high performance.
  * Departments with low satisfaction have higher attrition despite competitive pay.

**Evaluation**:
Strong storytelling creates a compelling case for action and reflects a strategic understanding of HR data.
